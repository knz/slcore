 Introduction to SLC
=====================

SLC, a generic SVP_ compiler.

.. _SVP: http://www.svp-home.org/

Installation
============

.. note:: The separate "SL installer" is highly recommended to automate
   installation. See: http://svp-dev.github.io/

To install slc on your system, type in the classical sequence at the
command prompt::

        ./configure
        make
        make install (as root)

Between ``make`` and ``make install``, you may also want to run::

        make check

This will ensure that the demo programs can be compiled with various
slc targets.

Requirements
============

The following tools are used by slc:

- GNU bash 3.x (3.2 or later)

- a standard ISO C99 compiler

- Python >=2.6 and <3.x (2.6 or later is required, 3.x not supported yet)

The following tools are also required, but can be installed using the
automated installer in the separate ``deploy`` package:

- GNU m4 1.4.x (1.4.6 or later), with patches to allow resetting the
  line counter and file name for error messages;

- GNU binutils 2.18+ modified with Microthreading extensions, supporting
  ``mtalpha`` and ``mtsparc`` targets;

- GCC 4.5+ modified to target Microthreaded architectures.

For more details about prerequisites, check out the separate CSA note
[sl13] for details.

Using slc
=========

The SL toolchain comes with several demonstration programs. Looking at
them is a good way to see what slc can support. They can be found in
the ``demo`` subdirectory of the separate ``sl-programs`` package.

See also
========

There are other sources of interest in the distribution:

- Headlines about the project can be found in the file ``NEWS``.

- Documentation about the input language SL and the accompanying
  software library can be found in the CSA notes at
  http://notes.svp-home.org/ 

- Additional documentation can be found in the ``doc/`` subdirectory.

Licensing
=========

This software is composed of the following two separate components:

- the SL compiler, able to produce object code from C/SL source
  form. The compiler is entirely contained in the ``tools/``
  subdirectory.  This is licensed under the terms of the GNU Public
  License, version 3.

- the SL library, necessary to produce complete executable programs
  from objects produced by the SL compiler. The library is contained
  in the ``lib/`` subdirectory. It is a composite software composed of:

  - the SVP-specific library code in:

    - ``lib/slsys``
    - ``lib/mgos/gfx``
    - ``lib/mgos/sep``
    
    This is licensed under the terms of the GNU Public License, version 3.

  - the Microgrid-specific library code in:

    - ``lib/libc``
    - ``lib/mipsel-sim``
    - subdirectories of ``lib/mgos`` not listed above.

    This is a composite package containing:
 
    - ``lib/libc/math/mipsel/``, ``lib/libc/math/,tsparc/``,
      ``lib/libc/math/mtalpha/m/``: a precompiled subset of the uClibc
      math library, compiled with ``slc``. The binary form is provided
      for convenience; it can be regenerated using ``slc`` from the
      uCLibc sources. uClibc is itself licensed under the terms of the
      Lesser GNU Public License (LGPL), version 2.1. A copy of uClibc
      can be obtained at http://www.uclibc.org/

      .. note:: To re-generate the math objecs: configure uClibc for
        the appropriate target; then modify ``Rules.mak`` to use ``slc
        -b ...`` as code generator; then run ``make``.

    - ``lib/libc/bsd/libc``: a modified subset of the FreeBSD C
      library. This is licensed under the terms of the BSD license.
      See the headers of each source file for licensing terms.

    - ``lib/libc/bsd/contrib/gdtoa``: a modified subset of the
      ``gdtoa`` software distributed with FreeBSD. This is licensed
      under the terms of a custom copyleft license by Lucent. See the
      headers of each source file for licensing terms.

    - ``lib/mipsel-sim/libgcc.a``, ``lib/mtsparc/sim/libgcc.a``:
      precompiled versions of GCC 4.7's embedded ``libgcc.a``,
      compiled using ``slc`` itself instead of ``gcc``. The binary
      form is provided as convenience; it can be regenerated usng
      ``slc`` from any GCC version. GCC 4.7 is licensed under the
      terms of the GNU Public License, version 3.

      .. note:: To re-generate ``mipsel-sim/libgcc.a``: configure gcc
	for target ``mipsel-linux-gnu``; then run ``make`` a first
	time; then manually edit ``mipsel-linux-gnu/libgcc/Makefile``
	in the build tree to use ``slc -b mipsel_s`` as code
	generator; then run ``make clean; make`` in
	``mipsel-linux-gnu/libgcc``.

      .. note:: To re-generate ``mtsparc-sim/libgcc.a``: configure gcc
	for target ``sparc-linux-gnu``; then run ``make`` a first
	time; then manually edit ``sparc-linux-gnu/libgcc/Makefile``
	in the build tree to use ``slc -b mtsn_s`` as code generator;
	ensure the compilation does not use ``-g``, ``-fPIC`` nor
	``-fbuilding-libgcc``; then run ``make clean; make`` in
	``sparc-linux-gnu/libgcc``.

    and derived ``configure``, and makefiles (files ``Makefile.in``,
    ``Makefile.am`` and filenames ending with ``.mk``). These are
